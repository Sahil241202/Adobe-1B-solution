## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. No sections selected**
- Check that PDFs contain extractable text (not scanned images)
- Verify persona and job descriptions are specific enough
- Ensure documents in `docs/` folder are relevant to your persona

**2. Irrelevant results**
- Make persona and job descriptions more specific and detailed
- Increase `diversity_weight` for broader content selection
- Check that your PDFs contain content relevant to your persona

**3. Processing errors**
- Ensure all packages from `requirements.txt` are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Verify BGE model files are present in `models/bge-small-en-v1.5/`
- Check that PDF files are accessible and not corrupted

**4. Performance issues**
- Enable caching with `"cache_embeddings": true` in model_settings
- Reduce `top_k` value for faster processing
- Clear `cache/` folder if corrupted: delete and recreate the directory

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by setting the logging level in `run_pipeline.py` or using environment variables:

**Windows:**
```cmd
set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;.
python run_pipeline.py
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:.
python run_pipeline.py
```

Check the console output for detailed processing information and any error messages.
