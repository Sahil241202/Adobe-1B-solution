From the left panel, select Fill in form fields , and then select the field where you want to add text. It displays a text field along with a toolbar. 2. Select the text field again and enter your text. 3. To reposition the text box to align it with the text field, select the textbox and hover over it. Once you see a plus icon with arrows, move the textbox to the desired position. 4. To edit the text, select the text box.
