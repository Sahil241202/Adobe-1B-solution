      "text": "What \u2019s the best way to create a PDF? You can create PDFs from documents printed on paper, Microsoft Word documents, InDesign\u00ae files, digital images, and more. Different types of sources have different tools available for PDF conversion. In many applications, you can create PDFs by selecting the Adobe PDF printer in the Print dialog box. If a file is open in its authoring application (such as a spreadsheet that is open in Microsoft Excel), you can convert it to PDF without opening Adobe Acrobat. Similarly, if Acrobat is already open, you don \u2019t have to open the authoring application to convert a file to PDF. Every PDF balances e\ufb03ciency (small file size) and quality (such as resolution and color). If the balance between the file size and th e quality is critical to your task, you must use an appropriate conversion method. For example, you can drag files to the Acrobat icon to create PDFs. In this case, Acrobat applies the most recently used conversion settings without providing access to thos e settings. If you want more control over the process, you \u2019ll want to use another method. PDF creation methods by file type Refer to the following lists to determine the methods available for the different types of files. File Type PDF Creation Methods Any file format Method 1 : From the top tools bar, select Create . Then, select a file type and then select the file that you want to convert to PDF. Or, select the hamburger menu (Windows) or the File menu (macOS) > Create and then select the appropriate file type and follow through the steps. Method 2 : Drag and drop a file from your system to the Acrobat Home page. Method 3: Right -click on the file and then select Convert to Adobe PDF .",

When you perform a task that uses your roaming ID, you\u2019re automatically logged in to the roaming ID server if your authentication assertion hasn\u2019t expired. PKCS#12 modules and tokens You can have multiple digital IDs that you use for different purposes, particularly if you sign documents in different roles or using different certification methods. Digital IDs are usually password protected. They can be stored on your computer in PKCS #12 file format. Digital IDs can also be stored on a smart card, hardware token, or in the Windows certificate store. Roaming IDs can be stored on a server. Acrobat includes a default signature handler that can access digital IDs from various locations. Register th e digital ID in Acrobat for it to be available for use. Store certificates on directory servers Directory servers are commonly used as centralized repositories of identities within an organization. The server acts as an ideal location to store user certif icates in enterprises that use certificate encryption. Directory servers let you locate certificates from network servers, including Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) servers. After you locate a certificate, you can add it to your list of truste d identities so that you don\u2019t have to look it up again. By developing a storage area for trusted certificates, you or a member of your workgroup can facilitate the use of encryption in the workgroup. For more information about directory servers, see the Digital Signature Guide . Import directory server settings (Windows only) You import directory server settings using security import/export methodology or a security settings file. Before, you import settings in a file using import/export methodology, ensure that you trust the file provider before opening it.",
